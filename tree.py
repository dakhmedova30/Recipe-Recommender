        Hints:

        To do this recursively, you'll need to recurse on both the tree argument
        (from self to a subtree) AND on the given items, using the "first" and "rest" idea
        from RecursiveLists. To access the "rest" of a built-in Python list, you can use
        list slicing: items[1:len(items)] or simply items[1:], or you can use a recursive helper method
        that takes an extra "current index" argument to keep track of the next move in the list to add.
