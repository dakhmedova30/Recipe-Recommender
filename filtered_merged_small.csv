I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal.

notes: 
i used 1.5 cans each of diced tomatoes and chick peas.
i browned the lamb in three batches instead of two to keep from overcrowding my 5 qt. dutch oven.
kept warm all afternoon by simmering on the stove on low.
i used fresh ginger (about 1 tbl) and no parsley or cilantro.
could have probably used a bit of salt at the end.","['lamb shoulder', 'salt', 'ground black pepper', 'vegetable oil', 'onions', 'garlic cloves', 'flour', 'low sodium chicken broth', 'tomatoes with juice', 'bay leaves', 'ground coriander', 'ground cumin', 'ground cinnamon', 'ground ginger', 'chickpeas', 'fresh parsley']",16
